# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on certain input features or risk factors. The model will be trained on a dataset containing historical data of individuals with and without diabetes, and will use this information to make predictions for new, unseen data.

## Features
- The project uses Python as the main programming language.
- It utilizes popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from reputable sources such as UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle.

## Repository Structure
The repository contains the following files and directories:
1. `data/`: This directory contains the raw dataset used for training the model.
2. `preprocessing.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook detailing how the raw data was preprocessed before being fed into the machine learning model. 
3. `model_training.ipynb`: This notebook outlines how the machine learning model was trained using preprocessed data.
4. `diabetes_prediction_model.pkl`: This file contains the trained machine learning model in pickle format.
5. `app.py`: A simple implementation of a web application using Flask where users can input their health information to get a prediction about their likelihood of having diabetes.

## Usage
To replicate this project's results or run your own predictions:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine: 
```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/diabetes-prediction-ml.git
```
2. Navigate into the cloned directory:
```
cd diabetes-prediction-ml/
```
3. Install required dependencies using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
4. Follow instructions in `preprocessing.ipynb` to preprocess your own dataset or use existing preprocessed data provided in this repository's `/data` directory.
5. Train your own machine learning models by following instructions in `model_training
